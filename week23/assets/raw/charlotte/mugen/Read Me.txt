------------------------------------------------------------------

Dos2Win is a tool that help you to convert mugen characters from dos to windows.

For an optimal use, you have to put the files "CharSffDtoW.exe" and "dos2win.exe" together.
As the author of the file "CharSffDtoW.exe" isn't available, I give you this file,
in his 0.08 version, in this package until his site come back.

What is made by this toll:
-------------------------
- convert all the "Clsn2 =" by "Clsn2:" in the AIR file
- convert all the "MoveContact = 1" by "MoveContact" in the CNS and CMD files
- convert all the "MoveGuarded = 1" by "MoveGuarded" in the CNS and CMD files
- convert all the "MoveHit = 1" by "MoveHit" in the CNS and CMD files
- convert all the "MoveContact = 0" by "!MoveContact" in the CNS and CMD files **new**
- convert all the "MoveGuarded = 0" by "!MoveGuarded" in the CNS and CMD files **new**
- convert all the "MoveHit = 0" by "!MoveHit" in the CNS and CMD files **new**
- execute CharSffDtoW to convert the SFF file

Utilisation:
------------
Put the files in the directory of the character you want to convert and execute dos2win.exe, isn't it easy? ;)

Support:
--------
There remain some limitations to the converting of the characters,
the "defaults.pal" aren't fixed in the DEF file, you have to do it 
manually, but this thing is very rare to do.
The count of the Clsn2 isn't made also, in this case you have to verify the
error message made by winmugen and correct the bug by yourself.

This tool can convert the characters for the linux version of mugen
but it can be unconvertible sometimes (if the files are written in upper case and not in
lower case). I propose you to use the tool "mugen2linux" avalaible on
http://zesensei.free.fr/mugen/tools/default.htm in addition.

Distribution:
-------------
My application is freeware, you can distribute it freely.
I give you the source code written in perl, if you want to modify or update it.

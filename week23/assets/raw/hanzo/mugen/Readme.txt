Hattori Hanzo 120% by starplatinum
You're welcome
--------------------------------------------------
STORY of how he came to be
-------------------------------
After bash i took time off to secretly work on something that would test me that's how terry (originally i had did 20% of rai from waku waku first) came about.i always said that ff3 was well animated and that version of terry was missing. so amidst learning vars i thought about doing a ninja master character,but i remembered i said i wanted hanzo from ss2 so bad that's when i got to work.
;-------------------------------------
History: supposed to be a homage paying char,a well known famous ninja by the name of Hattori Hanzo, chloe can explain it because she once gave his bio on her old forum.

P.S. does it make me a bad person cause i don't use paint shop pro or a debug bios? 

2)i hear a lot of people saying that mugen is dead because of what some brazilian people are doing with the winmugen bullshit, your killing this entire community slowly,elecbyte just close the door on some of us hopes for a real mugen in windows. with this dream deferred i am very liable to haul and beat the shit out of you idiots who throw rock at the 2d fighters mugen throne.if this in any way offends you, then i just hit my intended target you unappreciative bitch.i would love for you to know that the mugen world would be much better without you.
since this problem is way bigger than we could imagine i just hope you culprits get cut the bullshit out.if not damn your soul,your going to mugen hell in a limo with gaseline drawers on you homo.
